#### What open source contributions, research or visible leadership work have you done? If few, what 3 specific outcomes will you deliver in your first 90 days on the board in OWASP and how will members verify the progress?
<br>
<br>
While my primary contributions have been within enterprise environments rather than traditional open source projects, I bring a unique perspective that OWASP critically needs: scaling security practices across large, complex organizations with real-world constraints and business pressures.

<br>
<br>

#### What do you see as the top three challenges for OWASP to increase impact and visibility worldwide? Please provide actionable plan which you can spearhead and lead if need be for the goals you plan to achieve

#### Several OWASP projects are stale and leads are unresponsive. If elected, what is your concrete, time bound plan to triage these projects, re-engage with inactive leads or relaunch based on clear criteria and timelines?
<br>
<br>

If elected, I will lead this transformation with the same rigor as my focus in enterprise specific execution, program evangalism and delivery and the inclusiveness of open-source governance. 

Every decision will be data-driven, community-informed, and transparently reported across all 16 security domains i was able to classify the ~400 OWASP projects -  security domains spanning the complete security landscape [with my openion on some top hits, many of which need commited focus ]:
    1. Web Application Security  - Foundation domain with Top Ten, ASVS, Cheat Sheets
    2. AI/ML & GenAI Security - Fastest growing with Gen AI Security, LLM Top 10
    3. Supply Chain & Dependency Security  - Highest ROI with CycloneDX, Dependency-Check
    4. Cloud-Native & Container Security - Kubernetes, Docker, Serverless security
    5. DevSecOps & CI/CD Security  - SAMM, pipeline security frameworks
    6. Mobile Security  - Mobile Application Security, Mobile Top 10
    7. Vulnerability Management & Testing - DefectDojo, OWTF, testing tools
    8. Security Training & Education - Juice Shop, WebGoat, training platforms
    9. API Security  - Growing domain with API Security Project
    10. Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment  - Threat Dragon, risk frameworks
    11. Network Security & Intelligence - Amass, reconnaissance tools
    12. Code Security & Static Analysis  - ESAPI, code review guidance
    13. IoT & Emerging Technologies - Internet of Things, Low-Code security
    14. Privacy & Compliance - Privacy risks, compliance frameworks
    15. Application Firewall & Defense  - CRS, Coraza WAF
    16. Integration & Standards  - Cross-cutting integration approaches


The way i’ll propose approaching this will be thru Strategic Reality and board alignment: Data-Driven Assessment. Critical domains like Supply Chain Security create massive enterprise value. Just a quick review, close to 200 projects can be estimated as stale based on maintenance health, technical relevance, and leadership responsiveness across all domains. 

This requires executive-level intervention with community-driven solution, my proposal would be split into   3 phases for a 1 year plan to drive towards a healher, stringer and focused global project portfolio. 

Phase 1: Immediate Triage & Accountability [Target to accomplish within first 3 months]
Focus on building clear visibility into Automated Health Assessment,
* Deploy enterprise-grade metrics across all 398 projects: GitHub activity, issue responsiveness, technical debt indicators
* Domain-specific evaluation using our 16-category framework to assess strategic value vs. maintenance burden
	•	Public transparency dashboard showing real-time project health across all domains—no hiding, total accountability

Direct Leadership Engagement
* Personal outreach to 150+ project leaders across all 16 domains with clear response requirements (14-day deadline)
* Escalation protocol: Email → Slack → LinkedIn → Community nomination for replacement
	•	Document everything: Response rates, engagement quality, succession planning needs by domain

Strategic Value Classification
* Apply BCG matrix analysis to categorize projects within each domain: Stars (high value, active), Cash Cows (stable value), Question Marks (potential), Dogs (retirement candidates)
* Domain expert panel input from recognized leaders in each of the 16 security areas
	•	Transparent criteria publication for all triage decisions with domain-specific considerations


Phase 2: Domain-Focused Transformation [Month 4 to 6]
Priority Domain Investment Strategy
Tier 1 Critical Domains (Immediate Focus):
* Supply Chain & Dependency Security: review all and define and focus on key outcomes like → Emergency health investment for CycloneDX ecosystem [something everyone uses, and is aware needs love]
* Web Application Security:  → Aggressive consolidation while protecting Top Ten, ASVS legacy
* AI/ML & GenAI Security:  → Innovation acceleration as fastest-growing security domain

Tier 2 High-Impact Domains (Secondary Focus):
* DevSecOps & CI/CD Security → Enterprise pipeline integration focus
* Vulnerability Management & Testing  → Tool consolidation opportunity
* Security Training & Education (32 projects) → Community education mission preservation

Tier 3 Specialized Domains (Targeted Intervention):
* Cloud-Native, Mobile, API Security → Modernization for current tech stacks
* IoT, Privacy, Network Security → Emerging threat response and compliance alignment

Systematic Project Actions Across All Domains
Immediate Retirement (target 80 projects across domains):
* Integration & Standards:  like legacy integration approaches
* Code Security & Static Analysis:  projects outdated security libraries
* Network Security & Intelligence:  projects superseded by commercial tools [may require more focus to have value in oss]
* IoT & Emerging Technologies: projects still early experimental work 
* Clear exit criteria: Zero activity >18 months + technical obsolescence + no strategic value

Strategic Consolidation :
* Web Application Security:  stale projects →  maintained packages
* Vulnerability Management:  stale projects →  unified testing tools
* Security Training:  stale projects →  modernized learning platforms
* Community-driven migration support ensuring user continuity across all domains

Innovation Pipeline Launch:
* New project charter framework for emerging needs: Quantum Security, Web3, Zero-Trust Architecture
* Domain-specific innovation tracks are aligned with technology evolution in each area
* Community voting platform for prioritizing investments across all 16 domains
* Partner with genAI code gen solutions like cursor, claud code, github Copilot etc to build custom instruction projects or OWASP policy guardrails

Phase 3: Sustainable Governance & Community Ownership [Month 6-12]
Domain-Centric Leadership Model
* Establish 16 Domain Focus Groups with recognized community experts leading each security area
* Monthly domain community calls with cross-domain coordination for overlapping projects
* Annual OWASP Strategy Summit for portfolio planning across all security domains
Continuous Health Monitoring
* Quarterly automated assessments with domain-specific health metrics and early warning systems
* Public accountability reports showing progress against stale project reduction targets by domain
* Cross-domain innovation opportunities identifying synergies between security areas
Innovation & Modernization Framework
* Technology trend monitoring for emerging threats across all 16 domains
* Academic partnerships for research-driven development in each security area
* Enterprise advisory boards ensuring commercial relevance across the complete security landscape, Key focus on building stratergic partnerships with OSPOs of top enterprises 

Something each phase will be attached to will be Success Metrics & Community Accountability,
Setting OKR/SMART style goals to measure success, like,
Targets:
* Stale project rate: 49.5% → 25% through strategic retirement and health investment across domains
* Domain leadership: 100% of 16 domains have active focus groups and identified community leaders
* Leadership responsiveness: 90% response rate to community communications across all project areas
* Portfolio optimization: 398 → 250 strategically-focused projects across refined 16-domain structure
* Domain excellence: Each of 16 domains has clear value proposition and active community
* Innovation pipeline: 12+ new project charters developed through community prioritization across emerging security areas
* Documented Enterprise adoption and participation: 50% increase in Fortune 500 usage across core domains

While OWASP is open source and should always remain, my Leadership Philosophy will help drive Community-Driven Excellence Across All Security Domains
This challenge demands senior executive style enterprise thinking applied to open-source governance:
* Data-driven decisions with transparent criteria applied consistently across all 16 domains
* Direct accountability through personal engagement and public reporting on domain health
* Strategic focus on domains that create maximum value while preserving OWASP's comprehensive coverage
* Inclusive innovation where the best ideas win through democratic processes in each security area
The opportunity is unprecedented: Transform OWASP from a collection of 398 fragmented projects into 16 world-class security domains that define industry standards, drive innovation,  serve millions of developers and enterprises worldwide.

My focus will be to navigate OWASP towards  a healthier, more focused project portfolio spanning the complete security landscape. Within one year, we'll have a more strategically relevant open-source security ecosystem focused worldwide.
The community deserves nothing less than excellence in execution and accountability in leadership across every security domain. That's exactly what I'll plan deliver.

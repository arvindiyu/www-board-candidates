#### What open source contributions, research or visible leadership work have you done? If few, what 3 specific outcomes will you deliver in your first 90 days on the board in OWASP and how will members verify the progress?
<br>
<br>
While my primary contributions have been within enterprise environments rather than traditional open source projects, I bring a unique perspective that OWASP critically needs: scaling security practices across large, complex organizations with real-world constraints and business pressures.

#### Several OWASP projects are stale and leads are unresponsive. If elected, what is your concrete, time bound plan to triage these projects, re-engage with inactive leads or relaunch based on clear criteria and timelines?
<br>
<br>
If elected, I will lead this transformation with the same rigor as my focus on enterprise-specific execution, program evangelism and delivery, and the inclusiveness of open-source governance.

Every decision will be data-driven, community-informed, and transparently reported across all 16 security domains I was able to classify from the ~400 OWASP projects. These security domains span the complete security landscape, with my assessment of some top priorities that need committed focus:
**Foundation Domains:**
- **Web Application Security** - Foundation domain with Top Ten, ASVS, Cheat Sheets
- **AI/ML & GenAI Security** - Fastest growing with GenAI Security, LLM Top 10
- **Supply Chain & Dependency Security** - Highest ROI with CycloneDX, Dependency-Check
  
**Growth Domains:**
- **Cloud-Native & Container Security** - Kubernetes, Docker, Serverless security
- **DevSecOps & CI/CD Security** - SAMM, pipeline security frameworks
- **Mobile Security** - Mobile Application Security, Mobile Top 10
- **API Security** - Growing domain with API Security Project
  
**Essential Operations:**
- **Vulnerability Management & Testing** - DefectDojo, OWTF, testing tools
- **Security Training & Education** - Juice Shop, WebGoat, training platforms
- **Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment** - Threat Dragon, risk frameworks
  
**Specialized Domains:**
- **Network Security & Intelligence** - Amass, reconnaissance tools
- **Code Security & Static Analysis** - ESAPI, code review guidance
- **IoT & Emerging Technologies** - Internet of Things, Low-Code security
- **Privacy & Compliance** - Privacy risks, compliance frameworks
- **Application Firewall & Defense** - CRS, Coraza WAF
- **Integration & Standards** - Cross-cutting integration approaches

My approach centers on **Strategic Reality and Board Alignment** through **Data-Driven Assessment**. Critical domains like Supply Chain Security create massive enterprise value. However, close to 200 projects can be estimated as stale based on maintenance health, technical relevance, and leadership responsiveness across all domains.

This requires executive-level intervention with community-driven solutions. My proposal involves a **three-phase, 12-month plan** to drive toward a healthier, stronger, and more focused global project portfolio.

## Phase 1: Immediate Triage & Accountability **Timeline: First 3 months**
#### Automated Health Assessment
- Deploy enterprise-grade metrics across all 398 projects: GitHub activity, issue responsiveness, technical debt indicators
- Domain-specific evaluation using our 16-category framework to assess strategic value vs. maintenance burden
- Public transparency dashboard showing real-time project health across all domains—complete accountability, no hiding
#### Direct Leadership Engagement
- Personal outreach to 150+ project leaders across all 16 domains with clear response requirements (14-day deadline)
- Escalation protocol: Email → Slack → LinkedIn → Community nomination for replacement
- Document everything: Response rates, engagement quality, succession planning needs by domain
#### Strategic Value Classification
- Apply BCG matrix analysis to categorize projects within each domain: Stars (high value, active), Cash Cows (stable value), Question Marks (potential), Dogs (retirement candidates)
- Domain expert panel input from recognized leaders in each of the 16 security areas
- Transparent criteria publication for all triage decisions with domain-specific considerations

## Phase 2: Domain-Focused Transformation **Timeline: Months 4-6**
#### Priority Domain Investment Strategy
**Tier 1 Critical Domains (Immediate Focus):**
- **Supply Chain & Dependency Security:** Emergency health investment for CycloneDX ecosystem (something everyone uses and needs attention)
- **Web Application Security:** Aggressive consolidation while protecting Top Ten, ASVS legacy
- **AI/ML & GenAI Security:** Innovation acceleration as fastest-growing security domain
  
**Tier 2 High-Impact Domains (Secondary Focus):**
- **DevSecOps & CI/CD Security:** Enterprise pipeline integration focus
- **Vulnerability Management & Testing:** Tool consolidation opportunity
- **Security Training & Education:** Community education mission preservation
  
**Tier 3 Specialized Domains (Targeted Intervention):**
- **Cloud-Native, Mobile, API Security:** Modernization for current tech stacks
- **IoT, Privacy, Network Security:** Emerging threat response and compliance alignment

#### Systematic Project Actions Across All Domains
**Immediate Retirement (target: 20% projects across domains):**
- **Integration & Standards:** Legacy integration approaches
- **Code Security & Static Analysis:** Outdated security libraries
- **Network Security & Intelligence:** Projects superseded by commercial tools (may require more focus to have value in OSS)
- **IoT & Emerging Technologies:** Early experimental work projects
- **Clear exit criteria:** Zero activity >18 months + technical obsolescence + no strategic value
  
**Strategic Consolidation:**
- **Web Application Security:** Consolidate stale projects into maintained packages
- **Vulnerability Management:** Merge stale projects into unified testing tools
- **Security Training:** Modernize stale projects into contemporary learning platforms
- Community-driven migration support ensuring user continuity across all domains
  
**Innovation Pipeline Launch:**
- New project charter framework for emerging needs: Quantum Security, Web3, Zero-Trust Architecture
- Domain-specific innovation tracks aligned with technology evolution in each area
- Community voting platform for prioritizing investments across all 16 domains
- Partner with GenAI code generation solutions like Cursor, Claude, GitHub Copilot to build custom instruction projects and OWASP policy guardrails

## Phase 3: Sustainable Governance & Community Ownership **Timeline: Months 6-12 **
#### Domain-Centric Leadership Model
- Establish 16 Domain Focus Groups with recognized community experts leading each security area
- Monthly domain community calls with cross-domain coordination for overlapping projects
- Annual OWASP Strategy Summit for portfolio planning across all security domains
#### Continuous Health Monitoring
- Quarterly automated assessments with domain-specific health metrics and early warning systems
- Public accountability reports showing progress against stale project reduction targets by domain
- Cross-domain innovation opportunities identifying synergies between security areas
#### Innovation & Modernization Framework
- Technology trend monitoring for emerging threats across all 16 domains
- Academic partnerships for research-driven development in each security area
- Enterprise advisory boards ensuring commercial relevance across the complete security landscape
- Key focus on building strategic partnerships with OSPOs of top enterprises

## Success Metrics & Community Accountability
Each phase will be measured against **OKR/SMART style goals:**
### With set Targets like:
- **Stale project rate:** 49.5% → 25% through strategic retirement and health investment across domains
- **Domain leadership:** 100% of 16 domains have active focus groups and identified community leaders
- **Leadership responsiveness:** 90% response rate to community communications across all project areas
- **Portfolio optimization:** 398 → 250 strategically-focused projects across refined 16-domain structure
- **Domain excellence:** Each of 16 domains has clear value proposition and active community
- **Innovation pipeline:** 12+ new project charters developed through community prioritization across emerging security areas
- **Enterprise adoption and participation:** 50% increase in Fortune 500 usage across core domains, including documented partnerships with enterprise OSPOs



While OWASP is open source and should always remain so, my leadership philosophy will drive **Community-Driven Excellence Across All Security Domains**. This challenge demands senior executive-style enterprise thinking applied to open-source governance:
- **Data-driven decisions** with transparent criteria applied consistently across all 16 domains
- **Direct accountability** through personal engagement and public reporting on domain health
- **Strategic focus** on domains that create maximum value while preserving OWASP's comprehensive coverage
- **Inclusive innovation** where the best ideas win through democratic processes in each security area

## My Vision 
**Transform OWASP from a collection of 398 fragmented projects into 16 world-class security domains** that define industry standards, drive innovation, and serve millions of developers and enterprises worldwide.

My focus will be to navigate OWASP toward a healthier, more focused project portfolio spanning the complete security landscape. Within one year, we'll have a strategically relevant open-source security ecosystem with global impact. The community deserves nothing less than excellence in execution and accountability in leadership across every security domain. That's exactly what I will plan to deliver.
